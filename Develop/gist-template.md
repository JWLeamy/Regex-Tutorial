A regex is a sequence of Meta Characters

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

## Regex Components
It is neccesaryy to wrap any and all regular expressions within slash marks (/). The slash marks denote the start and finish of a Regex, and all characters within the two symbols are cosidered 'Components'.

### Anchors
A regex statement has two types of anchors <br>

- ```^``` the starting anchor <br> 
- ``` $ ``` the closing anchor <br>

Don't overthink the anchors - anything within these two anchors will help actually classify the value/pattern your regex is trying to identify, but the anchors themselves simply act as a starting/stopping point.

In our example, we see that aside from our slash marks that capture the regex, it starts with a ^ and end with a $
```
 /^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/ 
 ```
